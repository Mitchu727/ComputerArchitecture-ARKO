# Computer Architecture Projects
## Repository contains projects from Computer Architecture (Architektura Komputer√≥w - ARKO) course at Warsaw University of Technology
Goal of the project was to write a program that rotates a bmp format picture by 90 degrees.
Programs where written using following assembly languages: 
 - MIPS using MARS MIPS simulator - in this case a constraint was made that the picture dimensions should be divisible by 8
 - Intel 32 bit architecture on Linux - program is written in C, and the function in asm
 - Intel 64 bit architecture on Linux - same as above, with only small change in asm to get better use of 64 bit architecture

*Comments in code are written in polish*
